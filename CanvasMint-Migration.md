# CanvasMint Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the CanvasMint component from its current implementation as part of a larger application to a standalone library.

## Project Overview

CanvasMint is a canvas-based drawing and design tool that provides a rich set of features for creating and editing designs. It is currently implemented as a component within a larger application, but we want to extract it into a standalone library that can be used independently.

## Current Structure

The current implementation of CanvasMint is located in:

- `src/components/creative-studio/app.tsx`

It depends on various components and utilities from the parent application, which makes it difficult to extract and use independently.

## Migration Goals

1. Create a standalone version of CanvasMint that can be used independently
2. Maintain all existing functionality
3. Improve the API and documentation
4. Make it easy to extend with new features
5. Ensure compatibility with the parent application

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

- Analyze the current implementation to identify dependencies
- Identify components that need to be extracted
- Create a plan for the new architecture

### Phase 2: Implementation

- Create a new project structure
- Extract the core functionality into standalone components
- Implement a clean API for the library
- Create comprehensive documentation

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

- Test the standalone library to ensure it works correctly
- Refine the API based on testing feedback
- Create examples and demos

### Phase 4: Integration

- Integrate the standalone library back into the parent application
- Ensure compatibility with existing code
- Update documentation for the parent application

## New Project Structure

The new project structure is organized as follows:

```
canvasmint/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── CanvasMint/
│   │   ├── MenuBar/
│   │   ├── Toolbox/
│   │   ├── Properties/
│   │   └── SimpleCanvas/
│   ├── engine/
│   │   ├── core.ts
│   │   └── draw-tools/
│   ├── adapters/
│   │   ├── storage/
│   │   ├── file/
│   │   └── notification/
│   ├── store/
│   │   └── canvas-store.ts
│   └── utils/
├── demo/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.tsx
│   │   └── SimpleCanvasDemo.tsx
│   └── public/
└── README.md
```

## SimpleCanvas Component

As part of the migration, we've created a simplified version of the CanvasMint component called SimpleCanvas. This component provides a basic canvas drawing interface using Fabric.js, without the complexity of the full CanvasMint component.

The SimpleCanvas component can be used as a starting point for integrating canvas functionality into other applications, or as a reference for understanding the core functionality of CanvasMint.

## Migration Challenges

1. **Dependencies**: The current implementation depends on various components and utilities from the parent application. We need to identify these dependencies and either extract them or replace them with standalone alternatives.

2. **State Management**: The current implementation uses a complex state management system. We need to simplify this for the standalone library.

3. **API Design**: We need to design a clean and intuitive API for the standalone library that makes it easy to use and extend.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the extraction of all components and utilities
2. Implement a comprehensive test suite
3. Create detailed documentation
4. Publish the library to npm
5. Create examples and demos for common use cases

## Conclusion

The migration of CanvasMint to a standalone library will make it more flexible and easier to use in a variety of applications. By following this strategy, we can ensure a smooth transition while maintaining all existing functionality.
